# DMTerminal
## The minimalistic Dungeon Master's best friend

Working to be everything a Dungeon Master needs right within the terminal. This project will include:
* Dice roller (completed)
* Monster manual (in progress)
* Character sheet manager (next up)
* Spell manager (in the hole)
* Other stuff, if I think of it

Current status:
Dice roller completed, monster manual in beginning stages.

This project is in the extreme early stages, and as such will not be suitable for use for a long time.

## How to download
### Releases
Head over to the releases page, and I should have a stable release available for download! These are guaranteed to be not buggy (hopefully), and all features will be completely finished.
### Build it yourself
Clone the repo into a terminal and run `dmd -ofdmterminal *.d` in the folder. This method is not recommended, as there will be features that are unfinished and tons of bugs.
